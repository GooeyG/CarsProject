# QA community DevOps Project - Car/Engine tracker

## What my project shows

* A python based web app with complete CRUD functionality.
* Containers used to host my web application
* Jenkins to test and build my application

* [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/GooeyG/projects/1/views/1)

My kanban board features tags following MoSCoW priotisation technique, helping me achieve point targets based on the project marking criteria.
**You can also click on each objective on the kanban board to access my user stories located in the comments of the objective itself.**
I realize this isn't the ideal way to approach agile fundamentals in a devops environment but for the sake of the course it shows that I understand agile methodology. Eg. I didn't want to create sprints for this project as we have less than two weeks designated towards working on the project - Plus, all tasks are to be carried out by myself.
