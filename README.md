* [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/GooeyG/projects/1/views/1)

My kanban board features tags following MoSCoW priotisation technique, used in order to achieve point targets based on the project marking criteria.
You can also click on each objective on the kanban board to access my user stories located in the comments of the objective itself.
I realize this isn't the ideal way to approach agile fundamentals in a devops environment but for the sake of the course it shows that I understand agile methodology. Eg. I didn't want to create sprints for this project as we have less than two weeks designated towards working on the project - Plus, all tasks are to be carried out by myself.
